    <div class="item grid-item-2"><p>A trek carried out of curiosity spurred by greed and desire, The Cat wanders enshrouded by mist, bloomed by torchlight. 
        as the vapor thins, cast against the glacial moonlight is The Castle. Cobbled and dilapidated it beckons The Cat, its mist
        a Siren's call. The Cat's paws make way faster than his mind as his curious instincts guide him along the unkempt brickwork.
        The distant visage now an imposing monolith of stone and slate before him, a mantra permeates The Cat's mind...
        Riches! Jewels! Silver and Gold! All OF IT WILL BE MINE!
