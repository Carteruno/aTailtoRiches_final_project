    <h1>My Creative Process and Behind the Scenes</h1>

    <p> This Page is dedicated to the process of how this site came to be, I will mention some of the HTML process and bring light to how I drew up all the art
        seen on this site.
    </p>

    <h2> The Creator</h2>

    <p>While I do not wish to directly post my name here, My background is largely a passion for creating art followed by a professional pursuit of programming, HTML being
        a skill I am currently sharpening on the journey. I began drawing around the age of 13 and kept with it til now.

    <h3>The Art and The Process of Concepting</h3>

    <P>Below you will find sketches and thumbnails that culminated into the final product. Processes I employed such as free-sketching, thumbnailing and Design sheets
        can be found below. I will explain what these terms mean and how they contribute to a project such as this one. I Used Clip Studio Paint for the art that I 
        reconfigured for the pixel art workflow.
